# Roguelike

One wouldn't believe, but I'm still working on my little roguelike/dungeon crawler project. I switched over from Python/OpenGL to Haxe/NME because I'm currently working with Flash alot and Haxe seems to be a great typed language and cross-platform technology, so I can port my projects on mobile devices and stuff. I'm also using an entity-component system that I've ported from AS3 - [Ash](https://github.com/nadako/Ash-HaXe "Originally by Richard Lord!"), which seems to be a good decision because with this architecture I can keep things separated in the code.

I decided to revive this blog for now so I can share interesting decisions and implementations I'm making while developing this project. So I'm going to write articles about roguelike/dungeon-crawling programming-related stuff.
